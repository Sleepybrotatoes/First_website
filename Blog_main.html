            <h2>Start of everything</h2>
            <p>First official blog post. It is currently 4:38am and i have just finished setting up what i believe is the complete framework for my website. Funnily enough at the start of the night i was at work with 0 experience with html programming
                and now i have a fully functioning website. I thought about making this when i was at my friend Jadas house and Harrison and I were talking about how cool it would be to make minecraft mods with my java programming knowledge (i should say progressing programming knowledge) and he could design the models.
                i thought it would be cool to have a website to showcase not only the things we make but other projects im interested in and my thoughts and feelings while doing so.

            <h2>Early thoughts</h2>    
            <p>This Microsoft VScode AI thing is like actual CRACK for a developer. I literally just named this page the blogging page and this shit had me setting up email newsletters and shit with image refs and links out the waz and all i had to do was keep spamming tab, it feels like cheating and is probably how those
                fuckers in my programming class who have no IDEA what they are doing somehow write the most flawless program and finish up in 5 seconds but if you ask them how it works the fucking pencil sniffers look at you like you just beat their firstborn child with a rock. And also explains why they have notes
                in their code telling them what each block is doing when they dont need to show it to anyone except the professor who clearly knows their program is adding 2 numbers together its not rocket science. Anyways i just thought it was cool that this thing can literally read my mind as to what i want to do.

            <h2>Thinking of ideas</h2>    
            <p>Thinking of ideas to make a minecraft mod is hard. I have to think of a mod that people will actually want to play, and that i have the capabilities to create. im still kind of new to programming in general so im not sure im going to be able to make anything too complex. Probably some mobs and different items.
                I also could always just make addons to already existing mods, some of my friends have been palying Cobblemon recently and they are complainging that some of the mods dont work and they look simple enough shouldn't be too hard to make some changes that will also be appreciated by the general public.
