            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Kynan Patterson. I'm a student with a passion for creating and building things.
                I'm currently studying at the <a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/">University of Newcastle</a> in Australia where I am studying a bachelor of Computer Science.
                I'm also a graduate of <a href="https://thentrance-h.schools.nsw.gov.au/">The Entrance Campus</a> where I studied Information Processes and Technology.
                I'm interested in a wide range of topics including web development, data science, and general programming.
                I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a software engineer.</p>
